        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>By David Brunnstrom</b></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>HANOI (Reuters)</b> - 
        Vietnam's Communist Party chief Nong Duc Manh told China's parliamentary 
        leader Li Peng on Saturday he expected friendly ties and cooperation 
        between the communist neighbors would continue to improve. Meeting Li at 
        the presidential palace in Hanoi, Manh hailed the achievements of 
        China's Communist Party, especially the past 20 years of reform and 
        opening to the outside world.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Manh said present-day 
        Vietnam-China relations were based on &quot;16 Golden Words,&quot; 
        including &quot;neighborliness, friendship, multifaceted cooperation and 
        long-term stability.&quot; Manh, who embraced Li warmly, said his visit 
        was just the latest high-ranking exchange between the countries.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;(It) will, I 
        think, make an important contribution to creating a new momentum in 
        friendly relations and in the multi-faceted cooperation between the two 
        parties, states and peoples,&quot; he said. No details have merged of 
        talks since Li arrived on Friday on what has been described as an 
        &quot;official friendship visit.&quot; But discussions were expected to 
        include comparisons of respective political and economic conditions, 
        programs of reform and territorial issues, including rivalry in the 
        South China Sea.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">On the business side, 
        further talks are expected on cooperation in hydropower and mining. 
        Analysts say Li, chairman of China's National People's Congress, would 
        be keen to assess Vietnam's leadership changes since the five-yearly 
        Communist Party congress on April, at which Manh was elected in place of 
        Le Kha Phieu. Earlier in the day, Li was greeted with a hug from Phieu, 
        a man whose downfall was blamed by some diplomats and party sources on a 
        perceived excessive closeness to Beijing.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">RIVALS DESPITE SHARED 
        IDEOLOGY</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Among other things, 
        Phieu has been accused of giving too much away in border negotiations 
        with China, a traditional rival of Vietnam despite shared ideology.Phieu 
        told Li Vietnam and China were proud of shared socialist ideals, 
        &quot;even though each country's path has specific features.&quot; Li 
        will stay in Vietnam until Monday. He comes at a time when Hanoi is 
        working to finalize amendments to its 1992 constitution, which are 
        expected to enshrine rights of the private sector.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Last month, a government 
        spokeswoman said Vietnam was closely watching China's plans to allow 
        entrepreneurs to join the Communist Party, but added that each ruling 
        party needed to take into account its own specific conditions. Ahead of 
        its April congress, Vietnam's Communist Party rejected a proposal to 
        allow members to engage in business.In a meeting with President Tran Duc 
        Luong, Li conveyed an invitation from China's President Jiang Zemin for 
        him to visit Beijing, a city he visited late last year.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The official Vietnam 
        News Agency quoted Li as saying China was looking forward to a visit to 
        Beijing by Manh, but gave no dates for this visit. It said Li's 
        counterpart, National Assembly chairman Nguyen Van An, had accepted a 
        similar invitation.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Li met Phieu's 
        predecessor Do Muoi on Friday afternoon. Visiting communist dignitaries 
        have traditionally called on past party bosses, but Li's meeting with 
        Phieu appears unusual given that Vietnam's leadership battle was 
        reputedly extremely acrimonious.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Vietnam and China 
        normalized diplomatic ties in 1991, having fought a brief but bloody war 
        in 1979 after Vietnam invaded Cambodia and ousted the Beijing-backed 
        Khmer Rouge. Though relations have since greatly improved, the countries 
        remain at odds over disputed and reputedly oil-rich territory in the 
        South China Sea, including the Spratly archipelago.</font></p>
