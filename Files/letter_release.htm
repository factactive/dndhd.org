                detained by the Vietnamese Government without trial for more 
                than 2 years.</font>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The imposition 
                of an outdated law in today's society, the usurpation of 
                political power for corruption and private gains, the use of 
                forces to oppress legitimate and nonviolent political 
                dissidents, and the use of police and military to oppress 
                innocent people generally occur only in totalitarian and 
                dishonest regimes.</font>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">You and your 
                party are cause of Vietnam's national woes. You have failed to 
                lead the country on the right direction. You have not served the 
                Vietnamese people as a government of the people, by the people 
                and for the people would do. On the contrary, you have built 
                political machinery in the service of corruption, crime, and 
                evil. Specifically, you maintained a policy of suppressing 
                legitimate political dissidents, and of oppressing citizens who 
                pointed out your corruption and wrongdoing. Peoples of the world 
                have witnessed your deceit and crimes since. You should cease 
                such policies and practices. You should start to tell the truth, 
                do the right things, and start being honest.</font>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Your party's 
                consistent mistreatments The People's Action Party of Vietnam is 
                wrongful from political, moral, and justice viewpoints. For 
                review, in April of 1992 your party has persecuted The People's 
                Action Party of Vietnam, detaining members thereof over 400 
                days. In November of 1996, you unlawfully arrested 17 members of 
                our Party who reside in Cambodia and imprisoned them in Vietnam 
                over the objection of UN High Commission representatives. In 
                June of 1997, once more time, you secretly arrested another 4 
                members of our Party who were returning from Cambodia to Vietnam 
                to visist their relatives, including a Buddhist monk, Rev. Thich 
                Nhat Si.</font>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Most recently, 
                in the late February of this year, your secret police detained 
                me for more than 3 days for interrogation. You improperly 
                interrogated me about the activities of The People's Action 
                Party of Vietnam while I was on a medical mission on the 
                invitation of your Department of Health to teach the latest 
                heart treatment techniques and to treat Vietnamese patients who 
                have the emergency heart problems. Hundreds of patients were 
                disappointed with your decision to arrest and detain me. Your 
                decide that maintaining your political and power and privileges 
                is more important than the health of our people or the futures 
                of our country. In this same occasion, some of your party 
                members admitted to me that you have held 21 members of The 
                People's Action Party of Vietnam in Chi Hoa prison as your 
                political prisoners. But to date, you dare not to put them to 
                public trials. The reason is very simple. They have not 
                committed any crimes against anyone. Conversely, our Party is 
                supported by the people, and even some members of your party, 
                with good conscience, have agreed with our Party's positions. 
                For those reasons, you only response is to secretly oppress our 
                Party and deny your actions.</font>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">To remind you, 
                oppressing the innocent people is a crime of the government, and 
                is against moral values. Also oppressing nonviolent political 
                dissidents is not appropriate with today's civilized world. A 
                government committed to wrong doing, to ill-advised policy, and 
                which oppress its people is a regime of corruption and the 
                sources of crimes and will be dislodged completely. The people 
                of Vietnam know that you, yourselves are the party, the 
                government, the police, and the court of law ...You have all 
                powers, but sadly you do not have a good conscience which 
                belongs to moral Vietnameses.</font>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover, in 
                today's world, in reality, the problem of maintaining a 
                political monopoly to an individual, a organization or a 
                political party in any country, that is, a crooked imagination, 
                injustice, and only causing crimes. We believe, Mr. 
                Secretary-General may also agree to this notion of the people 
                and the world regardless what type of communist you are.</font>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In conclusion, 
                we urge you to rethink and reevaluate of your policies and 
                practices. You should immediately release 21 members of The 
                People's Action Party of Vietnam (17 were arrested in November 
                of 1996 and 4 members in June of 1997). Your detention of these 
                people over two years without trial, that means you even violate 
                your own law, the so-called provision 31 CP, even though it is a 
                kind of law to oppress the innocent people!</font>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">We expect you to 
                stop using action of oppression whenever the people criticize 
                you and your party. Dialogue instead of oppressing. Remember, 
                your policies and practices cause dissension and opposition by 
                the citizens. The people have right as human to present their 
                viewpoints and positions. We hope you will make the right 
                decisions in days ahead.</font>
