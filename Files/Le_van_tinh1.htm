        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">By David 
        Brunnstrom</font>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>HANOI, Aug 
        30 (Reuters)</b> - Vietnam said on Wednesday it was freeing more than 
        10,000 prisoners in its second mass jail clear-out of the year, among 
        them an elderly Vietnamese-Canadian whose daughter it executed for 
        heroin trafficking this year.</font>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Releasing 
        septuagenarian Tran Thi Cam, whose 44-year-old daughter Nguyen Thi Hiep 
        was shot by firing squad in April, should help patch relations with 
        Ottawa, which was incensed by the execution and downgraded ties.</font>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Cam was among 
        61 foreigners covered in the presidential amnesty for 10,693 convicts 
        announced ahead of the communist ruled country's 55th independence day 
        on Saturday.</font>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Vice Minister 
        for Public Security Le The Tiem said the foreigners came from countries 
        including the United States, Canada, Australia, France, Pakistan, 
        Thailand, Laos and Cambodia.</font>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">He said the 
        amnesty took affect from August 29 and hoped all those freed would be be 
        out of jail by Saturday.</font>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In April, 
        Vietnam freed 12,264 prisoners, including 29 foreigners, in its largest 
        ever prison amnesty, which marked the 25th anniversary of the communist 
        victory in the Vietnam War.</font>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It was unclear 
        if any of the 10,408 being freed from jail this time and the 285 being 
        released from suspended sentences included any political or religious 
        prisoners.</font>
        <p align="justify"><b><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"
        size="3">DISSIDENTS DON'T MEET CRITERIA</font></b>
        <p align="justify"><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Asked 
        about two dissidents cited by London-based human rights group Amnesty 
        International -- Nguyen Dinh Huy, founder of an illegal opposition party 
        jailed for 15 years in 1995, and Le Van Tinh, who has been serving a 
        20-year term -- Tiem said:</font>
        <p align="justify"><i><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"
        size="3">``They do not meet the conditions for the special amnesty at 
        this time.''</font></i>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Asked about two 
        religious leaders of concern to the European Union -- Le Kim Bien and 
        Phan Cong Hien of the Cao Dai Buddhist sect -- Nguyen Camh Dinh chairman 
        of the president's office, said he could not remember all the names on 
        the list.</font>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Tiem said the 
        amnesty covered prisoners who met stated criteria and ``really have 
        repented and rehabilitated themselves.''</font>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The prison 
        board said earlier this week foreigners who had served a quarter of 
        their sentences, or eight years of a life sentence, would be eligible 
        for the amnesty.</font>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Cam, in her mid 
        70s and jailed since 1996, fell into the category of ``other special 
        cases,'' Dinh said.</font>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Canada 
        expressed outrage at Hiep's execution, saying Hanoi reneged onpromises 
        to look at evidence Ottawa said cast doubt on her conviction. It 
        suspended ministerial contacts and aid talks in retaliation.</font>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">On Monday, 
        Canada strongly hinted it would normalise ties with Vietnam if Cam was 
        freed. It said Vietnam had quietly transferred Hiep's remains to 
        relatives on August 19.</font>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A Canadian 
        diplomat said earlier that four Canadians were detained in Vietnam and 
        it was not clear if all would be freed.</font>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Rights groups 
        estimate Vietnam holds at least dozens of dissidents in jail and greatly 
        restricts movement of dozens it has previously freed.</font>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">They say it is 
        difficult to determine exact numbers of prisoners of conscience because 
        of Vietnam's climate of secrecy.</font>
